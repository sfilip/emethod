This directory contains everything related to integer addition.
Specifically,
- work related to pipelined adders of reasonable size
	(IntAdderClassical, IntAdderAlternative, IntAdderShortLatency)
- work related to fast adder structures for very large adders
	(all the others)

All this is documented in Pasca's papers below:
